#🍎 Fruit Classifier using Teachable Machine & Keras  
This project is a simple image classification tool that detects types of fruits (e.g., Apple, Orange) using a model trained with Google’s Teachable Machine and deployed via a Python script using Keras.

##🎯 Project Goal  
Learn how to:

- Train a custom image classification model using Teachable Machine  
- Export the model in TensorFlow Keras format  
- Load and use the model in Python  
- Preprocess input images and predict their class  
- Test multiple images and view confidence scores

📦 Tools & Technologies  
- Google Teachable Machine (Image Project)  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Python (PIL, NumPy)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / VS Code  
- GitHub for version control  

---

🧠 Classes Used  
The model is trained to classify between at least two fruits:

- Apple  
- Orange  

(You can extend to more classes like Banana, Kiwi, etc.)
